This repository demonstrates a common error in Rust when using iterators: going out of bounds.  The `bug.rs` file contains code that attempts to access elements beyond the iterator's bounds. The `bugSolution.rs` provides a corrected version that safely handles the end of the iterator.  Understanding how to properly handle iterator exhaustion is crucial for writing robust Rust code.
